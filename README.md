# Accord – iOS App For Fragrance Reviews

## About the Project

Accord is an iOS app developed by me, Dayo Araújo, designed to help users explore, record, and discover their olfactory preferences.

The app allows you to write down what you like in a fragrance and classify its traits, such as projection and sillage or even the season in which the fragrance performs better.

What started as a passion for fragrance turned into an elegant, user-friendly application that merges technology with sensory memory.

## Features

- Search through the fragrance catalog.
- Retrieve important information about any specific fragrance available on the app.
- Visual interface inspired by the 1980/1990 whimsical goth aesthetic for a nostalgic and mystic feel.
- Reviews with text and classifications that can be looked back into.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: For developing the user interface in a modern, declarative, and responsive way.
- **Core Data**: Object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple for managing the model layer objects in applications across Apple platforms
