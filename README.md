# Accord â€“ iOS App For Fragrance Reviews

## About the Project

Accord is an iOS app developed by me, Dayo AraÃºjo, designed to help users explore, record, and discover their olfactory preferences.

The app allows you to write down what you like in a fragrance and classify its traits, such as projection and sillage or even the season in which the fragrance performs better.

What started as a passion for fragrance turned into an elegant, user-friendly application that merges technology with sensory memory.
